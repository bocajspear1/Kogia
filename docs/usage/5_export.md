# Exporting

Exporting allows users to store, display, and convert Kogia data into other formats for use in other systems, such as other analysis systems, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and other security software. Exporting is also done via export plugins. Using the interface in Kogia, the data is submitted to a plugin to be converted and downloaded. The interface dynamically adjusts for each export plugin.

To export data, from the job view select "Export." This will bring up the interface to export data from the current job.
