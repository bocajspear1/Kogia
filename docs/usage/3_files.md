# Submissions and Files

Files in Kogia are organized into submissions, which can contain one or more files. This includes files uploaded and any files extracted or discovered by plugins during analysis.

## Submissions

Submissions can be viewed in detail by going to "Submissions" and selecting a submission name from the list. The Submissions page shows details about a single submission, allows download of the entire submission, provides a button to run new jobs on a submission, and provides a link to view the individual files that make up the submission.
